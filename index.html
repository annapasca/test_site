<h2 id="ref-project-description">Project description</h2>

<div class="description">
We are delighted to announce the official launch of the EEGManyPipelines
 project! This project is inspired by other recent projects involving 
many independent analysis teams to investigate how different analysts 
approach a given data set and how analysis approaches affect the 
obtained results (e.g., <a href="#ref-references">Silberzahn et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-references">Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020</a>).
 The aim of this project is to extend this novel initiative to EEG 
research. We believe this to be particularly important in the case of 
EEG data, as compared to other neuroimaging research, analysis pipelines
 are less standardized (e.g. see <a href="#ref-references">Cohen, 2017</a>)
 and have more degrees of freedom. EEG is the most widespread tool in 
human neuroscience research with significant impact on research in all 
fields of psychology and cognitive neuroscience, which, we believe, 
makes the EEGManyPipelines project a timely and crucial endeavor that we
 hope will benefit a large part of the cognitive neuroscience community.
<br><br>
Participants in this project will get access to an EEG dataset and are 
invited to analyze the data with an analysis pipeline they deem sensible
 and representative of their own research. Participants will then report
 their results and a detailed description of the analysis pipeline back 
to us. We will use these reports to map the diversity of analysis 
pipelines and the effect of pipeline parameters on obtained results.  
<br><br>
